# Mine game [`Mine game`](https://mine-diamond.vercel.app/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

This is a simple mine game project. You can play the game by clicking on the cells. If you click on a mine, you will lose the game. If you click on a cell that has no mine, you will see a gem. Your job is to find all the gems without clicking on any mine.
